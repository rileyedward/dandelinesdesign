                        My name is Michele Grotenhuis, the creator behind Dandelines Design. My main focus is Event Planning, however, I have always had a true passion for textiles and every kind of art medium imaginable. As long as I can remember. I have wanted to own my own business to create shoppable displays with a combo of art and a curated selection of things I love
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am excited to expand beyond events creatively. I invite you to follow along, be inspired by the details of our beautifully designed events as well as the specially selected items of textiles and art pieces I will share I would love to meet and consult on any design project you are planning whether it be an upcoming event, or that floral design, or that perfect piece that completes a room. Please reach out, lets meet and get creative!
